        <say-as interpret-as="characters">ASR</say-as>, or Automatic Speech Recognition,
        has come a long way in recent years.
        <break time="300ms"/>
        When we talk about fine-tuning <say-as interpret-as="characters">STT</say-as> models,
        we're referring to the process of adapting pre-trained models to specific use cases.
