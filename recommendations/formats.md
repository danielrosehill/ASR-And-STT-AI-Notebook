# Recommendations / Learnings 

- Don't touch  your Hugging Face repos! Once you've fine-tuned and generated your original data, treat this as your pristine source of truth. If you're retraining, use it for that. Before you begin trying to convert to different formats and quants, create a copy of your models and use that as the source in your scripts. Ensure it's detached from remote. All just little safety checks to prevent accidental deletion/modification of weights (etc) without even having to go to VC. 
- Format liberally! Fine tuning an ASR is hard work (but rewarding). To derive maximum utility from your models, you may wish to use it on a wide variety of hardware - ranging from powerful workstations through to your smartphone. The various ASR engines and formats are a bit of a headache. But from early experience, it's worth investing time here. Evals/WER benchmarking is a loyal friend: you can use it to see exactly (and if) you're losing performance when trying to make the model accessible for more devices.
