The user (Daniel) has gathered questions about STT fine-tuning in the prompts folder.

Here's the workflow:

- Prompts that are queued for execution go in to-run 
- Answer them one by one. For each, create a note for this notebook and make sure to add the Claude Code attribution 
- When done, move that prompt into processed and move onto the next one
